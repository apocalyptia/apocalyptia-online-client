------ TODO LIST ------

UX/UI:
	Make some CSS effects to reflect character's current Psyche.
	Make a sidenav menu with icons as a table of contents in Rules section.
	Probably also a sidenav for character sheet.

Gear.js:
	Storage: Unit conversions still need work.
	make Consumable functionality for Gear objects
	add fishing line
	add metal cup
	add firelog
	add trauma sheers
	add antiseptic of some kind

Manual:
	Finish integrating Narrator sections: Bases, Environment, Factions, Missions, Preparation, Scenarios, Difficulties, Psyche

Markup:
	Add <abbr> tag to all abbreviations. ex: <abbr title="Constitution">C</abbr>

Character:
	Figure out how to track Pain and tag each point with a source since they go away at different rates.

Diseases:
	Fix Diseases that are currently incorrect.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------ BRAINSTORMING ------

- Bonus XP each session? Some is given by Narrator. Some points are allocated by vote by the Team. Some of these are auto-calculated by the system like badges (most damage dealt, move successes, etc)?

Abilities:
	Some kind of CQB Ability allowing you to split Rapid attacks between two targets.

Combat:
	Actions:
		Grappling: What about Submissions? Both Grabbed?
		Work on this more. Finish making separate Grappling-related Maneuvers where relevant. Make advanced Maneuvers conditional by Status more than relying on this staged approach. Add a static bonus (+3) or make opponent Defenseless when they are Grabbed. Defenseless fits an established pattern better I think. Maybe replace other bonuses with Defenseless effect? Some things should stack together though.
		'When you have Succeeded at a Grab, you get a bonus to any ATK made against the grappled opponent equal to your MATK roll - their DEF. If they attempt to escape but fail, readjust your bonus to be your most recent Grapple roll to maintain the grab - their failed escape roll. As an action while grappling, you may attempt to improve your grip and position by making another Melee vs Melee roll with your Success bonus. The result is your new Grapple Difficulty for the enemy to escape. If you fail, the enemy has moved 1 step up on the grapple scale toward escape. A grappled enemy must succeed on a grapple check to move 1 step up the grapple scale. A success while grabbed means escape. A fail readjusts the grapple bonus to be the difference between your roll and the attacker. When you succeed while grabbed, you may forego escape to use your roll to reverse the grapple and grab the attacker instead.'

Character:
	Character Sheet:
		Combine Health with Armor somehow.
		Make + item button do something.
		Refactor DescriptionSection.svelte to be an each list

Figure out a quick Jury-Rig version of Build.
