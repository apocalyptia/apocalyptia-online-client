<div id="AreasEncountersSec" class="Sec2">
    <p>Apocalyptia is designed to be easy to run, especially for a first-time GN. Using the AREA and ENCOUNTER tables provide a way to randomly generate a dynamic game world. This section is meant to be a supplement to the story, not a replacement for it. The GN can use this section to maintain a steady pace of game play and to spark new ideas if the game session becomes stale and boring. The GN can save game time by rolling a list of random AREAS and/or ENCOUNTERS before the session begins.</p>
    <p>The two basic types of AREAS the Team may wander through in the Wasteland are RURAL and URBAN. RURAL encompasses small towns, farmlands, and the surrounding countryside. These places are usually a little safer but the looting is sparse. URBAN includes downtown business districts, industrial sprawl, and suburban neighborhoods. These places are full of loot but tend to be much more dangerous and harder to escape.</p>
    <p>AREAS can be rolled whenever the Team takes off in an unexplored direction. The GN may roll even/odd on d6 to determine if there is an ENCOUNTER waiting at the new AREA. ENCOUNTERS could be rolled at least once per day, even when the Team is not traveling. SCENARIO ENCOUNTER tables are given at the end of this section and at the end of the chapter under the Scenario that you chose for your game. All Extras are listed in Ch:5.</p>
    <button id="AreaScavengingBtn" class="Btn">SCAVENGING</button>
    <div id="AreaScavengingSec" class="Sec3">
        <p>AREAS have a listed Perception # to find one item in that AREA. Scavenging can be attempted once every 15mins. Once a Player has Failed a Perception roll in an AREA, the Character becomes convinced that there is nothing left to find there. A Botch provokes a random ENCOUNTER roll. Notes give the rolls needed to determine how many items are at the AREA and the Loot table on which to roll in order to find out what those items are. AREA LOOT tables can be found in the next section. The MASTER GEAR LIST (MGL) is the default random loot list. The MGL can be found at the beginning and end of this book.</p>

    <button id="ProximityAndNumberBtn" class="Btn">PROXIMITY AND NUMBER</button>
    <div id="ProximityAndNumberSec" class="Sec3">
        <p>Each ENCOUNTER has a listed Proximity multiplier (1-100) and a Number of Extras to roll. Roll [d6 x Proximity] for the distance in yards between the Team and the Extra(s). Roll Number to see how many of the Extra(s) appear. Notes give a brief description of the Extras' typical behavior. The GN may secretly compare each side's highest Perception vs the lowest Stealth to see which side becomes aware of the other first. If a Character is actively sneaking, they may remain hidden when the rest of the Team is spotted.</p>
