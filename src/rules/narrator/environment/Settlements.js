<div id='SettlementsSec' class='Sec2'>
	<p>Humans naturally seek to band together. A successful Base, strategically placed with strong fortifications, can grow over time into a Settlement. Large numbers of survivors can congregate in Settlements and begin to rebuild civilization. This requires the cooperation of many different people with varying agendas and therefore some form of organizational system must be developed.</p>
	<button id='PoliticsBtn' class='Btn'>POLITICS</button>
	<div id='PoliticsSec' class='Sec3'>
		<p>Humans often come into conflict with each other. When the conflict is serious, it could threaten an entire Settlement. All Settlements have some set of laws which are prohibitions on certain behavior and consequences for ignoring those prohibitions. Whatever power (formal or de facto) determines and enforces these laws is a government. There are three basic forms of government: autocracy, oligarchy, and democracy.</p>

		<div id='OligarchySec' class='Sec4'>

		<button id='DemocracyBtn' class='Btn'>DEMOCRACY</button>
		<div id='DemocracySec' class='Sec4'>
			<p>This is a minimal government in which the people collectively decide major issues. Small issues and specialized functions may be delegated to representative groups. This is usually the slowest form of government.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The path a Settlement takes involves many factors including the personalities of influential people, availability of resources, and the culture of the populace. Any system on such a small scale is very fragile. A few determined and organized people could theoretically overthrow any existing system and set up their own. In any case, the responsibility assumed by any leader is enormous.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Settlements require as a bare minimum: a clean Water source, reasonable shelter, and strong fortifications. Once these are met, Settlements can grow to include some or all of the BASE FEATURES listed in the previous section as well as SETTLEMENT FEATURES:</p>

	<div id='CommerceSec' class='Sec3'>
		<p>Trade for goods and services is essential to rebuilding civilization. Artisans and Traders with their own shops, as well as the open Market in general, give the Team the opportunity to off-load Gear they do not want and trade for things they can use. It is for this convenient access to scarce resources that otherwise bitter enemies usually leave their feuds at the gate upon entering an organized Settlement. What happens outside is another matter entirely.</p>
		<p>Only the most advanced Settlements will develop a currency system, and so barter must be used as a rough substitute. Use Socialize vs Socialize to haggle. Every point of Success adds +1 Value to the winner's offer in the trade. Traders will only make deals that seem to give them at least a little profit. To get a rough idea of commonly accepted Values, consult the table below:</p>

			<p>No matter how well-stocked a Trader is or how productive an Artisan may be, there is always a limit to the quantity and selection of goods available in a given store. If a Character wants a specific item, roll Luck 6# with a penalty equal to the item's Rarity (see MGL at the end of this book). Some Traders keep Scavengers on call for special orders. It usually takes a number of weeks equal to the item's Rarity for a Scavenger to return with the item. Special deliveries are very expensive.</p>
		</div>
		<button id='SlaveryBtn' class='Btn'>SLAVERY</button>
		<div id='SlaverySec' class='Sec4'>
			<p>Despite much evidence to the contrary, a human life is a highly valuable thing in the Wasteland. Though not tolerated in all Settlements, some extremely inhumane places have allowed the age-old scourge of slavery to go on unchallenged or even encouraged. Wranglers kidnap people and drag them to slave markets where they fetch a high price from unscrupulous Traders. Men are usually put into labor camps while women are forced to be Hookers and children are brainwashed into Child Soldiers. Slave-traders know they have to watch their backs because there are still many people of integrity out in the wastes who will kill for freedom, be it their own or someone else's.</p>

	<button id='SettlementEncountersBtn' class='Btn'>SETTLEMENT ENCOUNTERS</button>
	<div id='SettlementEncountersSec' class='Sec3'>
		<p>Below is a sample of the types of people the Team is likely to come across in a sizable Settlement, along with a brief description of what they may want or have to offer the Team. One thing the Narrator should keep in mind when playing these Extras is that few people have any incentive to tell the truth to the Team upon first meeting them. The Team is an exploitable opportunity for many desperate Settlement dwellers. Everybody needs something and most people are capable of doing terrible things to get what they need.</p>
		<p>Citizens of a Settlement often do not see many new faces from day to day. The things that Characters do in a Settlement will be remembered and contribute to the reputation of the Character and their Team. Rumors can spread quickly, even from Settlement to Settlement as Traders and travelers drift through. Enemies will usually wait to attack out in the Wasteland rather than cause a scene among witnesses. Friends, on the other hand, can offer protection, information, and favors.</p>
		<p>During a first encounter with a new Extra, the Player should roll Perception vs the Extras' Socialize roll to be able to tell if the Extra is acting suspicious or seems trustworthy.</p>

			<p>Roll a d6 to see how many powerful Factions reside within the Settlement. Then roll d66 on the SETTLEMENT FACTIONS table once per Faction to determine which Factions hold sway. The order rolled indicates their relative standing from least to most powerful.</p>
			<p>To find out what and how many enemy Factions roam outside of the Settlement’s borders, roll d6/2 for the number of enemies, then roll d66 on SETTLEMENT FACTIONS to determine who they are.</p>
			<p>If a Faction type is rolled for both a Settlement Faction and an Enemy, these will be two distinct and opposing Factions that happen to have similar organizational structure and ideology.</p>
