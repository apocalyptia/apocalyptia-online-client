	<div id='DiplomacyMissionSec' class='Sec3'>
		<p>Establishing relationships between groups is essential for rebuilding civilization. When meeting new Extras, the Character (if meeting individually) or the Team leader (if meeting collectively), rolls Socialize vs Socialize to establish a First Impression. The degree of Success or Failure acts as a modifier to the Extra's Attitude for subsequent social rolls during that exchange. See HUMANS in Ch:5 for typical Attitude modifiers. The Team's reputation in another Settlement or Faction may cause further modifiers if the Extra has heard of the Team.</p>

		<div id='NegotiationMissionSec' class='Sec4'>
			<p>Signing peace treaties, determining territorial borders, arranging prisoner swaps, and working out trade deals all require Negotiation. Any representative must have authority from their Faction or Settlement. Each side will have a list of demands. Representatives roll Socialize vs Socialize on each demand. Some demands may simply be non-negotiable.</p>

		<button id='RecruitingMissionBtn' class='Btn'>RECRUITING</button>
		<div id='RecruitingMissionSec' class='Sec4'>
			<p>Roll Leadership vs Demeanor (average 6# for common Extras) to recruit an Extra who is not a member of a Faction. Recruiting someone out of their current Faction causes a penalty to the roll (usually -3 or more). Recruiting can only be tried 1/day, and retries only work when something significant has changed.</p>

		<div id='InterrogationMissionSec' class='Sec4'>
			<p>Getting information out of someone who has no motivation to assist you, or who actively resists questioning, is usually accomplished with one of the three following rolls vs Demeanor. These methods each require a d6 minutes. Failed rolls can be tried again at -3 per Failure that day. After a total number of Failures = your Demeanor, you give up from frustration.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Coercion: Leadership (Taunt). Brandishing a weapon adds the greater of DMG or Size as a bonus.</li>
				<li>Deception: Entertain(Lie).</li>
				<li>Reasoning: Brains.</li>

At 0 Psyche, either the torturer gives up or the prisoner is broken and can be controlled by Leadership, Medicine (Psychology), or Tame, # = Demeanor.</p>
