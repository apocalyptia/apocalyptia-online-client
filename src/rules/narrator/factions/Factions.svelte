<button id='FactionsBtn' class='Btn'>FACTIONS</button>
<div id='FactionsSec' class='Sec2'>
	<p>People in the Wasteland seek out survivors who look, act, and think like they do. There is safety in numbers. Factions form along demographic and ideological lines which often results in homogeneous tribes. Some Factions can work together. Others are mortal enemies. Convincing these Factions to reconcile their differences and cooperate with each other will be critical in order to save humanity. Joining a Faction requires good will, proven devotion, and taking the Allegiance Ability. There are fifteen major Faction types in the Wasteland. They interact as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cautious: Receptive to cooperation but always alert.</li>
		<li>Distrustful: Highly suspicious but not instantly hostile.</li>
		<li>Aggressive: Eager to fight under almost any circumstances.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The table below shows how the Factions in the left column typically feel about the Factions on the top row. Higher numbers indicate worse relations. These feelings are not always reciprocal. Some Factions are natural allies, while others are sworn enemies. Changing these prejudices requires time, effort, and wisdom.</p>
